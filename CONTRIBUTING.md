### Go Styleguide

* Follow the [Go Code Review Comments](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/CodeReviewComments)

* Use tabs for indentation
* Use double quotes for strings
* Use template literals when interpolating variables

* Avoid using `any` type in TypeScript; use proper types or generics
* Use React hooks and functional components instead of class components
* Organize imports with the Biome organizeImports feature

### CSS/Styling Styleguide

* Use Tailwind CSS classes for styling

* Reference methods and classes in markdown with the custom `{...}` notation:
    * Reference methods: `{Class#method}`
    * Reference a class: `{Class}`
* Include code examples where appropriate
* Keep documentation up-to-date with code changes
